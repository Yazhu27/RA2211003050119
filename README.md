AIM :  

                        The aim of this project is to design, configure, and simulate a network topology that effectively connects a Local Area Network (LAN) and a Wide Area Network (WAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer. This includes ensuring proper communication between devices across different networks by implementing and testing a complete network setup. 

 

OBJECTIVE: 

                      Create and configure a suitable topology for both LAN and WAN using 10-15 computers, routers, and switches. Simulate the transmission of a message from one network to a computer in another network. 

 

PROCEDURE: 

STEP – 1 - Topology Design: 

Design a network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer that includes both LAN and WAN configurations. 

LAN Configuration: 

Include at least 10 computers connected to switches. 

WAN Configuration: 

Connect the LAN network to another network using routers. 

STEP – 2 - Network Setup in Cisco Packet Tracer: 

Add Devices: 

Place and connect 10-15 computers within the network. 

Add at least 2 switches for the LAN setup. 

Add at least 2 routers for the WAN setup. 

Configure IP Addresses: 

Assign unique IP addresses to all computers within the LAN. 

Configure the router interfaces with appropriate IP addresses. 

Set up routing protocols or static routes as required to facilitate WAN communication. 

STEP – 3 - Configuration Steps: 

LAN Configuration: 

Connect computers to the switches. 

Assign and configure IP addresses on each computer. 

Connect the switches as needed. 

WAN Configuration: 

Connect the routers to each other to establish the WAN. 

Configure the IP addresses on the router interfaces. 

Set up either static or dynamic routing to ensure seamless connectivity between LANs. 

STEP – 4 - Simulation: 

Send a Message: 

Use the simulation mode in Cisco Packet Tracer. 

Configure and send a message from one computer in a LAN to another computer in a different network. 

Capture and verify the successful transmission of the message. 

STEP – 5 - Documentation: 

Create a Step-by-Step Procedure Document: 

Document each step taken during network configuration and simulation. 

Include all commands and settings used. 

Take Screenshots: 

Capture screenshots of the network topology. 

Capture screenshots of the successful message transmission. 

Save Packet Tracer File: 

Save the completed network configuration and simulation as a Packet Tracer (.pkt) file. 

RESULT : 

               The network topology was successfully designed and configured using Cisco Packet Tracer, enabling seamless communication between LAN and WAN. The simulation confirmed successful message transmission across networks, validating the setup.
